    /*
Data structure - technique of storing and organizing data in such a way that the data can be utilized in an efficient manner.
2 types : Linear and Non-linear data structure.

Linear - accessed sequentially eg- Array, Queue, Stack, LinkedList
Stack- uses LIFO(Last In-First Out)
      - addition of data element in a stack is a push operation and deletion pop operation
Queue - Uses First In-First Out (enqueue) and dequeue
Linked list: - 2 parts data element and reference to the next node in the sequence

Non-Linear - not arranged in a contiguous manner.
            Trees and Graphs.
            Tree- non-linear DS consists of various linked nodes(Parent-child relationship)
            Graphs - has a finite number of vertices and edges

        SOLID principles:
        Single Responsibility- one reason to change
        Open/Closed methods,classes - extend a class behaviour without modifying it
        Liskovs Substitution - child-parent clasess usability
        Interface Segregation- each interface specific responsibility
        Dependency inversion- use abstration, decouple the dependecies.
